"""
The code snippet above—that can be run with python queries.py,—shows how easy it is to use SQLAlchemy ORM to query data. To retrieve all movies from the database, we just needed to fetch a session from the session factory, use it to get a query associated with Movie, and then call the all() function on this query object. The Query API provides dozens of useful functions like all(). In the following list, we can see a brief explanation about the most important ones:
"""

# 2 - extract a session
session = Session()

# 3 - extract all movies
movies = session.query(Movie).all()

# 4 - print movies' details
print('\n### All movies:')
for movie in movies:
    print(f'{movie.title} was released on {movie.release_date}')
print('')


# 5 - get movies after 15-01-01
movies = session.query(Movie) \
    .filter(Movie.release_date > date(2015, 1, 1)) \
    .all()

print('### Recent movies:')
for movie in movies:
    print(f'{movie.title} was released after 2015')
print('')

# 6 - movies that Dwayne Johnson participated
the_rock_movies = session.query(Movie) \
    .join(Actor, Movie.actors) \
    .filter(Actor.name == 'Dwayne Johnson') \
    .all()

print('### Dwayne Johnson movies:')
for movie in the_rock_movies:
    print(f'The Rock starred in {movie.title}')
print('')

# 7 - get actors that have house in Glendale
glendale_stars = session.query(Actor) \
    .join(ContactDetails) \
    .filter(ContactDetails.address.ilike('%glendale%')) \
    .all()

print('### Actors that live in Glendale:')
for actor in glendale_stars:
    print(f'{actor.name} has a house in Glendale')
print('')
